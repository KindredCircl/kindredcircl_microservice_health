# Health Microservice

This microservice is responsible for monitoring the health of other services and infrastructure within the KindredCircl ecosystem. It provides endpoints for checking the status and performance of various components, enabling proactive monitoring and alerting.

## Features

* **Health Checks:**
    * Performs periodic health checks on registered services and infrastructure components.
    * Supports various health check types (e.g., HTTP, TCP, ICMP).
    * Configurable health check intervals and thresholds.
* **Status Reporting:**
    * Provides a centralized dashboard for viewing the health status of all monitored components.
    * Offers API endpoints for retrieving health status information in different formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
* **Alerting:**
    * Triggers alerts based on configurable rules and thresholds.
    * Supports various alerting channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
* **Metrics Collection:**
    * Collects performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rate) during health checks.
    * Exposes metrics for integration with monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

## Architecture

The Health Microservice is built using a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and integration with different monitoring tools and services.

* **Health Check Manager:** Responsible for scheduling and executing health checks.
* **Alerting Engine:** Evaluates health check results and triggers alerts based on configured rules.
* **Metrics Collector:** Gathers performance metrics during health checks.
* **API Gateway:** Exposes endpoints for retrieving health status and metrics.
* **Data Store:** Stores health check results, metrics, and configuration data.

## Dependencies
